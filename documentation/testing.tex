\chapter{System  and Unit Testing}

Testing was first done on small parts of the program, and as we added more, we tested larger parts of the program.

\section{Overview}
In general, we began testing on a lower level by testing our 
capabilities for rerouting input and output. Once we managed that,
we moved on to comparing output files to the test case files. Once Dr. 
Logar released the test cases, we created a function to confirm directory 
traversals. Then, when we combined the two, our program functioned correctly
and we were able to add the finishing touches.



\section{Dependencies}
No dependencies.


\section{Test Setup and Execution}
In earlier phases of the sprint, a simple “Hello World!” .cpp file was created to test the usage of system commands to compile and run a program within our testing software.
