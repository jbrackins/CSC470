\section{Project  Management Approach}
The aproach taken to manage this project is {\tt scrum}. The project is broken into tasks to be completed over two weeks sprint. The tasks are listed in {\tt Spring Backlog} in trello. During the sprint, the team meets for ten minutes scrum meetings to explain their progress, next steps, and impediments. 


\section{Phase  Overview}
Once a team member starts a given task, then the task is moved from {\tt Spring Backlog} to {\tt In Progress}. A done task is then moved to {\tt Ready for Testing} tab. After a completed task is test, then it is stamped as {\tt Complete}. Then the member moves to the next task of higher priority.
