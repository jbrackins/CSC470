\section{Overview}
Basic tests were run on this code. Each section was individually tested. That is, the function to compile and execute the source code was tested before it was integrated, as was the recurssive directory search. 



\section{Dependencies}
There weren't many dependencies when testing the functions of this program. 

The user needs only to ensure the c++ source code will compile and execute without any major bugs, such as infinite loops. 


\section{Test Setup and Execution}
For the end product we ran the test cases supplied by Dr. Logar for this project.

When testing other portions of the code other test cases were developed. For example, when writing the code to open, compile, and execute c++ source code some c++ programs were written and the output was analyzed to ensure the program ran correctly. When testing the code to walk through directories arbitrary directories were used to ensure the code would walk through the entire directory,
