\chapter{Development Environment}

\section{Development IDE and Tools}
A Linux environment was used with generic text editors. Most compiling, testing, and debugging was done in the Linux Terminal. QT was used for some debugging and editing the code. 

\section{Source  Control}
The source control system used was GIT. We used GitHub to create the repository and add each team member as a collaborator. A developer needs to be added to the repository as collaborator in order to edit the source code. 

\section{Dependencies}
Dependencies for this project are Linux, g++, and QT. The way these were used is mentioned above.
