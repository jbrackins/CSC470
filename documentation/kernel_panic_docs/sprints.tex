\section{Sprint Report \#1}
At this point there is only one sprint. So far, our product seems to be functioning. There are no known bugs in our project related to Assignment Grader.\newline
\newline
However, the usablility of our product the end of this first stage is not overwhelmingly positive. It meets each of the requirements outlined by the user stories. However, it does do "good practice" error checking (discussed previously in the "Phase Overview" section).\newline
\newline
For a first release version (or Alpha version to be more realistic), this meets everything that it is required to meet. However, it has a long ways to go in the future before it would be considered a full release.\newline
\newline
In the interest of the future of the product, the members of Kernel\_Panic will remain in their current positions for the next sprint.
