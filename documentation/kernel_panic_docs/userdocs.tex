Answer files will also need to be availible and should have the .ans extension. The program is executed and the test and answer cases are compared in order to grade a Computer Science student. 

The end user will need to have Linux installed on their machine. In Linux the user will also need the g++ compiler. The user will need to have valid c++ source code file names, .tst file names, and .ans file names. A valid directory is needed so that the program will produce results.
