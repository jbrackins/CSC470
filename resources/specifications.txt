#Copypasta from Jon's Product Specifications Meeting with Dr. Logar

Hey guys,

Here's the stuff from the meeting on Friday.

As far as I can tell, the purpose of the program will be to grade a student's file, comparing it 
to multiple test case files. It'll be called like this:

 grade <filename>

It will grade the file, looking through the current directory for any *.tst files, which 
will contain the test cases. We must compile the program, which is in c++. 

It is understood that all inputs will be valid (no error checking, program won't crash, etc..)
The program will be tested on numeric computations.
If it uses files, they'll be input.txt and output.txt.

<filename>.log will contain the results of each test case.

The idea is to grab the test case, copy it to input.txt, run the program, compare outputs, and 
put results into the log file.

*.tst files will have a test case followed by a blank line, followed by expected results.

Use system calls, and list that under vulnerabilities in documentation

Timeline: FEBRUARY 16

Programs to be tested are guaranteed to compile on linux lab machines. Test programs and test 
cases will be provided.

Make sure to keep track of time spent.

It may be helpful to create a python/linux script and convert it to c++.

Focus on testing the tester, not the programs.

SECTION FIVE OF DOCUMENTATION IS IMPORTANT

Use SVN or GIT, and ask Logar for help setting these up.

User Guide should be made 1 page, so keep it simple.

We can ask Logar any questions we have.
