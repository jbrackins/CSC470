\chapter{Mission}

The mission statement for this project has been to create a test suite to compile and run student-submitted C++ source code. The test suite will generate test cases and their corresponding answers as needed. Each C++ source file will produce a log file when graded. This log will contain information about the test performed, such as code coverage, performance, and the percent of test cases passed. More detailed information may be found in later sections of this document.
