\section{User Guide}

This product is to make grading an easy, not-so-meticulous task. Here is the structure you need to have your {\tt .cpp} files:

	\begin{itemize} 
  		\item The root directory
  		\item Individual subdirectories for each student (Use students' names as directory names)
  		\item A tests' subdirectory
	\end{itemize} 
	
This software will create individual log files for each student in the appropriate student's subdirectory. It will also create a summary file in the root directory containing all the students' names with their earned grades. If they have not passed a critical test, they will get {\tt FAILED} for their grade entity.
