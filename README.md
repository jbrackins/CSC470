ore wa jakku bawaa

Thank you in advance for giving us an A on this project!

Usage:
type "make" to compile the source code located in the "sprint2" directory.
The test executable should be run in the same folder as the golden.cpp file in order
for the program to run properly!

Our documentation pdf can be located in the "resources" directory.
